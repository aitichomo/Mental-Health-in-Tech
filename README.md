# Mental Health in Tech Survey

## Overview
Explore and analyze mental health data in the tech industry with this Colab notebook. Gain insights into the prevalence of mental health issues, factors influencing them, and trends over the years.

## Highlights
- In-depth analysis of mental health survey data.
- Visualizations illustrating trends and patterns.
- Machine learning models predicting mental health outcomes.
- Codebase for reproducibility and further exploration.
## Features and Feature Engineering

We have incorporated relevant features and performed feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of our models. Some of the features include 'Age', 'self_employed', 'family_history', 'no_employees', and a new feature 'interaction_feature' created from 'Age' and 'no_employees'.

## Decision Tree Classification

We have implemented a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn to predict 'mental_health_status'. The model is trained on the dataset, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report metrics.
